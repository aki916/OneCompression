# QuantizedModelLoader

Loader for quantized models saved by OneComp.

On macOS, `load_quantized_model()` places the model on MPS when available
(CUDA > MPS > CPU via `get_default_device()`). Use Transformers `generate()` for
inference; vLLM requires Linux with an NVIDIA GPU. See the
[macOS / MPS guide](../user-guide/mps.md#inference-with-transformers).

## Nemotron-H ModelOpt checkpoints

For NVIDIA Nemotron-3 Ultra converted with QEP/GPTQ, use the safetensors
`load_quantized_model()` API. The loader creates the architecture on the meta
device and assigns saved weights, keeping individual MoE experts packed. It
checks that Mamba parameters, router weights, and other required tensors are
present before returning an evaluation-mode model.

`device_map="cpu"` keeps the model on CPU; `device_map="auto"` distributes it
with Accelerate while keeping each hybrid decoder block together. An explicit
module-to-device dictionary is also accepted. Sufficient memory for the packed
weights and inference working space is still required. See the
[Nemotron QEP example](../algorithms/qep.md#nemotron-h-modelopt-nvfp4fp8-checkpoints)
for saving and generation usage.

## Convenience Functions

The top-level aliases provide shortcuts for both formats:

```python
from onecomp import load_quantized_model, load_quantized_model_pt

# Load a safetensors model, including BlockWisePTQ / GlobalPTQ / GlobalPTQDistributed
# outputs. If a LoRA adapter sidecar (lora_adapter/) is present it is auto-detected
# and applied, so LoRA models saved with save_quantized_model() load here too.
model, tokenizer = load_quantized_model("./saved_model")

# Keep the loaded model on CPU before running additional post-processes
model, tokenizer = load_quantized_model("./saved_model", device_map=None)

# Load a legacy PyTorch .pt model (whole-object torch.save; prefer the
# safetensors load_quantized_model() above, including for LoRA).
# Requires explicit opt-in: the .pt loader uses torch.load(weights_only=False),
# which can execute code from a malicious file (CWE-502). Only enable this for
# model.pt files from a fully trusted source.
model, tokenizer = load_quantized_model_pt(
    "./saved_model_lora", allow_unsafe_deserialization=True
)
```

!!! warning "Unsafe deserialization (.pt loader)"
    `load_quantized_model_pt()` loads `model.pt` with
    `torch.load(..., weights_only=False)`. Because PyTorch `.pt` checkpoints use
    Python `pickle`, a maliciously crafted `model.pt` can execute arbitrary code
    during loading (CWE-502). The method refuses to load unless you pass
    `allow_unsafe_deserialization=True`. Only opt in for models you produced
    yourself or obtained from a fully trusted source. For untrusted or
    third-party models, prefer the safetensors-based `load_quantized_model()`,
    which does not execute code.


!!! note "Research/development use only"
    `load_quantized_model_pt()` (and the `.pt` save/load path in general)
    is intended for **research and development** only -- for example, to
    quickly experiment with a new post-process before it has a
    safetensors-compatible `load_quantized_model()` implementation. It is
    **not recommended** for general or production use; prefer the
    safetensors-based `load_quantized_model()`, which is HF-compatible and
    does not execute code.
