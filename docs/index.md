# Fujitsu One Compression

**Open-source Python library for post-training quantization of Large Language Models**

---

Fujitsu One Compression (OneComp) is an open-source Python library for post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs).
It implements state-of-the-art quantization algorithms including GPTQ, DBF, RTN, and the novel
**Quantization Error Propagation (QEP)** method proposed in our NeurIPS 2025 paper.

## Key Features

- **Multiple quantization algorithms** -- GPTQ, DBF (Double Binary Factorization), RTN (Round-To-Nearest), JointQ, QuIP, and more
- **Quantization Error Propagation (QEP)** -- A novel method that adjusts weights before quantization to compensate for error propagation across layers
- **Simple, unified API** -- Configure model, quantizer, and runner in a few lines of code
- **Save/Load pipeline** -- Save quantized models in a format compatible with Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM
- **Evaluation tools** -- Built-in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy benchmarks

## Quick Example

Quantize any Hugging Face model in a single line -- with QEP, GPTQ 4-bit quantization,
evaluation (perplexity + accuracy), and model saving all handled automatically:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from onecomp import Runner

    Runner.auto_run(model_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    onecomp meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
    ```

For full control over each step, see the [step-by-step workflow](user-guide/basic-usage.md#detailed-workflow).
